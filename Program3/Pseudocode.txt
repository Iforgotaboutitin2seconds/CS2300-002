Pseudocode for task1.py

function solveX(D, E)

    define Identiy matrix I

    calculate I-D and round it to nearest hundredth by Gauss-Jordan elimination

    find x by multiplying (I - D)^-1 with E

    round x to nearest tenth

    return x 

read D and E from file
use function solveX to find X
print the result
output the result into output1.txt

Pseudocode for task2.py

read the points
create matrix x and y
find x^Tx and x^Ty
find A using the above data
use A to get least squares regression line
print the line and graph using 3rd party stuff
